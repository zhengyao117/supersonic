### Added

- Add function call parser and embedding recall parser
- Add plugin management
- Add web page query and web service query
- Metric filter query support querying metrics and comparing them in different dimensions

## SuperSonic [0.6.0] - 2023-07-16

### Added

- Support llm parser and llm api server - users can query data through complex natural language.
- Support fuzzy query dimension and metric name - users can set the 'metric.dimension.threshold'
  parameter to control the fuzzy threshold.
- Support query filter and domain filter in query and search - users can specify domainId and query
  filter to filter the results in search and query.
- Support standalone mode - users can integrate semantic and chat services in one process for easy
  management and debugging.
- Support dsl query in semantic - users can specify DSL language to query data in Semantic. In the
  past, data querying was limited to struct language.
- Add unit and integration testing - add integration tests for single-turn and multi-turn
  conversations, to efficiently validate the code.

  and query.
- Add scheduled semantic metadata update functionality in chat.
- Support create datasource by table name in the web page.
- Add the ability to set permissions for domain.
- Add a local/Remote implementation to the SemanticLayer interface.

### Updated

- Code architecture adjustment in chat.

1) Abstracting into three modules, namely api, core, and knowledge. Providing four core interfaces:
   SchemaMapper, SemanticLayer, SemanticParser, and SemanticQuery.
2) Add RuleSemanticQuery and LLMSemanticQuery implement to SemanticQuery.
3) Add all possible queries to the candidate queries, and then select the most suitable query from
   the candidate queries.

- Code architecture adjustment in semantic.

1) Refactor semantic layer SQL parsing code through Calcite.
2) Add QueryOptimizer interface.

- Chat config subdivided into detailed and metric scenarios - users can set different parameters in these two scenarios.
